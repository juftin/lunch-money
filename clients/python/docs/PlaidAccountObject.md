## Example

```python

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of PlaidAccountObject from a JSON string
plaid_account_object_instance = PlaidAccountObject.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(PlaidAccountObject.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
plaid_account_object_dict = plaid_account_object_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of PlaidAccountObject from a dict
plaid_account_object_from_dict = PlaidAccountObject.from_dict(plaid_account_object_dict)
